# MVP traceability audit

**Updated:** 2026-06-25 (Phase 6 planned: sprints 45–49)  
**Purpose:** Line-by-line check — competitor research → `docs/02-mvp-scope.md` → sprint tasks → **actual codebase**  
**Competitor synthesis:** `competitor-research/targets/convertlabs/reports/gap-analysis.md` (local, gitignored)  
**Profile gaps:** `docs/audits/business-profile-gaps.md`  
**Full roadmap:** `docs/audits/product-gaps-roadmap.md` (Phases 3–6)  
**Post-MVP ADR:** `docs/adr/0007-post-mvp-p2-scope.md`  
**Current status:** `tasks/competitor-parity-status.md`  
**Extensive audit plan:** `tasks/competitor-parity-audit-plan.md` (Parts 0–14)

Run this audit **before each sprint kickoff**. Do not start new competitor crawls unless a row is marked "needs CL spec."

## Research inventory — what was checked

| Report / source | Captures | Used in audit? |
|-----------------|----------|----------------|
| `COMPETITOR-TEARDOWN-REPORT.md` | Master | ✅ |
| `gap-analysis.md` | Synthesis table | ✅ |
| `upnext-mvp-recommendations.md` | PO backlog | ✅ |
| `user-flows.md` | 7 flows + parity tags | ✅ |
| `app-coverage.md` | 195 owner app pages | ✅ Module checklist |
| `navigation-map.md` | Tabs/sidebars | ✅ Settings + wizards |
| `provider-job-workflow.md` | Crew state machine | ✅ |
| `customer-portal.md` | 3-tab portal | ✅ P1 defer |
| `public-booking-standalone.md` | 10 form sections | ✅ |
| `onboarding-wizard.md` | 4-step signup | ✅ |

| Help center | 4 articles | 🟡 Not full crawl — OK for MVP |

**Previous pass (earlier session):** MVP scope ↔ sprints only — caught checklist/photos drift.  
**This pass:** All flow reports + `app-coverage.md` + **grep mock pages in codebase**.

---

## Code reality — pages still on mock / shell UI

These were **missed** in the first audit because sprint files assumed "built" when only list views were wired.

| Route | Research reference | Code today | Sprint fix |
|-------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| `/app/bookings/[id]` | Owner booking detail row (weak CL capture) | **✅ Wired sprint 06** | — |
| `/app/settings/business` | CL `/company`, Getting Started | **Sectioned form** — logo/Places/cards in **35–36** | **35** |
| `/app/settings/notifications` | CL Settings → Notifications (3 audiences) | **Static toggles** — not persisted | **07** — persist + connect to sprint 06 senders |
| `/app/dashboard` | CL Dashboard widgets | **Real data** — ops polish **43–44** | **43** |
| `/app/payments` | CL Invoices / awaiting payment | **✅ Real data** | Done sprint 06 |

**Real data confirmed:** `/app/bookings` (list), `/app/jobs`, `/app/jobs/[id]`, `/app/customers`, `/app/calendar`, `/app/team`, `/app/services`, `/app/settings/availability`, `/book/[slug]`, `/crew/*`
