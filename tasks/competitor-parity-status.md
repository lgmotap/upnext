## Gaps that matter for sales ("same as ConvertLabs")

### Closed in sprints 14–21 ✅

1. Recurring JobSeries + cron — sprint 14  
2. Pricing parameters bed/bath — sprint 15 (half-bath/sq ft → **sprint 23**)  
3. Portal cancel + saved cards — sprint 16 (password → **sprint 26**)  
4. CSV customer import — sprint 17  
5. Per-worker availability — sprint 18  
6. Read API + webhooks — sprint 20  
7. Custom domain doc — sprint 21 (host routing → **sprint 25**)

### P1 — scheduled (sprints 22–31) ✅ complete

See `tasks/full-product-roadmap.md` Phase 2.

### Phase 3 — company profile & onboarding (sprints 35–36)

| Sprint | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| 35 | Service area unify; logo upload; website URL |
| 36 | Google Places; industry cards; sign-up/name dedup |

Detail: `docs/audits/business-profile-gaps.md`

### Phase 4 — ops polish (sprints 37–42)

| Sprint | Gap | Status |
|--------|-----|--------|
| 37 | Reports date range + CSV export | ✅ |
| 38 | Customer tabs + tags | ✅ |
| 39 | Bookings inbox pagination/filters/bulk | ✅ |
| 40 | Manual booking fields + payment + review | ✅ |

### Phase 5 — dashboard parity (sprints 43–44)

| Sprint | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| 43 | CL ops KPI queues, deep links, today enrichment, crew activity |
| 44 | 30d snapshot, time-aware greeting, post-checklist business row |

Audit: `canvases/dashboard-vs-convertlabs.canvas.tsx`

### Already ahead (say it in sales)

- Crew web checklist + photos (CL web lacks both)
- Focused nav (~10 working modules vs 15+)
- Industry catalog seed on onboarding
- Magic-link portal (no password friction)

### Do not build (position against CL)

- Website builder, marketing campaigns, quotes pipeline, gift cards, payouts, multi-location, native apps
